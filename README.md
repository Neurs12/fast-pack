# Fast pack
A fun little tool use when you **REALLY** wanna play Minecraft 1.8.9 BedWars YIPPE but don't have the time to install all stuff required for it.

> [!NOTE]
> This pack uses a custom resource pack that is somewhat questionable (memes), but SFW, trust me.

> [!WARNING]
> Uses SKLauncher, comes with configurated OptiFine 1.8.9 and three popular <sub><sup>cracked</sup></sub> servers.

Open up Powershell and type this command:
```
irm fpack.pages.dev/setup.ps1 | iex
```
This is completely safe, you can check the source code.
